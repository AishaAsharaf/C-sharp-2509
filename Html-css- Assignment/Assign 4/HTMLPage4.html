                If you are a beginner and want to start with the basics, we recommend you to get clay,
                a small ceramic kiln, a basic pottery wheel, and a few modeling tools.
                You can always upgrade your equipment as you learn new techniques to make pottery at home.

            <p class="para">
                The main factor to look out for in order to check that your pottery is
                dry is that the color of your clay turns lighter. Additionally the piece will
                weigh lighter because the clay will lose around 20% moisture if dried properly.
                A good test is to hold the clay against your skin - if it still feels cold then it
                is probably not dry. It should feel like room temperature if dry.
